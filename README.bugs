How to report a bug

   Having users is great, not only because it is the purpose of creating
   this program in the first place, but because they stress your program
   in many different ways and help you make it more robust.

   If you do encounter a problem with this program, plase write a bug
   report at [2]http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712

   When you write your report, I'd be thankful if you could follow these
   guidelines, in order of importance.
    1. Make sure that the most current version does have the bug. Not only
       does this mean to download the latest version, but also making sure
       that you are _running_ the latest version. Go to src and run as
       ./etherape
    2. Things to include:
          + Operating system and distribution
          + EtherApe version (etherape --version, or check the about box)
          + pcap version (and package version as well)
          + gtk and gnome libs version (package version as well)
          + If possible, a backtrace (See below)
          + Please leave an email address or log in before posting your
            bug, so that I can later get in contact with you.
    3. Read this link first
       [3]http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html It is
       really informative, and it will be really useful not only for
       etherape.

   Please understand that I _love_ to receive bug reports, because that
   means that I will be improving the program, but the more info you
   provide, the faster I'll be able to solve the problem.

How to provide a backtrace

   In cases in which etherape is crashing (not when it produces bad
   results), it is most useful if I can see what was the program doing
   when it crashed.

   It is actually simple, you just need to type four instructions.

# export GNOME_DISABLE_CRASH_DIALOG=1
# gdb etherape
(gdb) run [options your were using]
(gdb) backtrace

   Here's an example of what it would look like. When you write your
   report, you only need to send me from the "Program received signal
   SIGSEGV" bit onwards.
